So this is my Task-01, which is ready and completed. 


# Notes:
TASK-01: Decision Tree Classification
📌 What is it?
A Decision Tree is a flowchart-like structure used to make decisions or predictions by splitting data into smaller and smaller subsets based on feature conditions.

It’s commonly used for:

Classification problems (predicting labels)

Regression (predicting values)

🛠️ What is used?
Library: Scikit-Learn

Algorithm: DecisionTreeClassifier

Visualization Tools: Matplotlib, Graphviz (optional for better tree plots)

💡 Why is it used?
Easy to understand and interpret (like following yes/no questions)

Requires minimal data preparation

Handles both numerical and categorical data

🔍 How I tackled it:
Selected Dataset: Any classification dataset (for example, Iris, Titanic, or a custom dataset).

Preprocessing: Cleaned the dataset, handled missing values if necessary.

Model Building: Used DecisionTreeClassifier from scikit-learn.

Visualization: Plotted the decision tree to understand the splitting logic.

Evaluation: Measured accuracy, visualized decision boundaries, and interpreted the tree.
